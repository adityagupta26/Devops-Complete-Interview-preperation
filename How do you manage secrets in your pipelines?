Managing **secrets in CI/CD pipelines** is **critical for security** — you never want to hardcode credentials like API keys, passwords, or tokens in your code or pipeline files.

Here’s how you can manage secrets securely:

---

### 🔐 **1. Use Built-in Secret Management (Best Practice)**

Most CI/CD tools offer built-in ways to store and access secrets securely:

| Tool         | Secret Storage Feature           |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **GitHub Actions** | Encrypted `Secrets` in repository/org |
| **GitLab CI**      | CI/CD `Variables` (masked, protected) |
| **Jenkins**        | `Credentials` plugin + Vault integrations |
| **CircleCI**       | `Project Environment Variables`          |

✅ Secrets are **encrypted at rest**, and you can access them in pipeline scripts.

#### 🔧 Example (GitHub Actions):
```yaml
env:
  DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
```

### 🏦 **2. External Secret Managers (Advanced + Scalable)**

Use a dedicated secret management tool for better control and rotation:

- **HashiCorp Vault**
- **AWS Secrets Manager**
- **Azure Key Vault**
- **Google Secret Manager**

CI/CD pipelines authenticate to the vault and pull secrets on demand.

#### ✅ Benefits:
- Fine-grained access control
- Dynamic secrets (auto-rotated)
- Centralized management

### 🧱 **3. Secret Injection at Runtime**

Inject secrets into your pipeline:
- As **environment variables**
- From a **vault fetch script** (using tools like `vault`, `aws-cli`)
- Mounted into containers via **volumes** (in Kubernetes, for example)

---

### 🚫 **What NOT to Do**
- ❌ Hardcoding secrets in:
  - Code (`config.py`, `.env`)
  - CI files (`.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`)
- ❌ Printing secrets to logs
- ❌ Committing `.env` files to Git

---

### 🛡️ Bonus: Tips for Managing Secrets Well

- 🔄 Rotate secrets regularly
- 🔍 Audit access to secrets
- ⛔ Limit scope (use least privilege)
- 🧪 Scan repos and CI logs for accidental leaks
