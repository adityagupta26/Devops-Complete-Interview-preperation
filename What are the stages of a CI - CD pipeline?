The **stages of a CI/CD pipeline** represent the **phases** your code goes through from commit to deployment. While tools and teams may customize this, a standard CI/CD pipeline usually follows these core stages:

---

### 🔧 **1. Source / Trigger**
- **What happens?**  
  Pipeline is triggered by a code push, merge request, tag, or a scheduled job.
- **Example:**  
  `git push` to `main` triggers the pipeline.

---

### 🛠️ **2. Build**
- **What happens?**  
  The source code is compiled or packaged.
- **Purpose:**  
  Ensure the code can build successfully and dependencies are installed.
- **Example:**  
  `npm run build`, `mvn package`, or build a Docker image.

---

### 🧪 **3. Test**
- **What happens?**  
  Run automated tests: unit, integration, or functional tests.
- **Purpose:**  
  Validate that the code behaves correctly and doesn’t break existing features.
- **Example:**  
  `npm test`, `pytest`, or `go test ./...`

---

### 🔍 **4. Analyze (Optional but recommended)**
- **What happens?**  
  Perform static code analysis, linting, security scanning.
- **Purpose:**  
  Enforce code quality and detect vulnerabilities early.
- **Example:**  
  `eslint`, `sonarqube`, `trivy`

---

### 📦 **5. Package / Artifact**
- **What happens?**  
  Build artifacts are stored (JAR files, Docker images, binaries, etc.).
- **Purpose:**  
  Reusable, versioned packages for deployment or distribution.
- **Example:**  
  Push Docker image to DockerHub or JAR to Nexus.

---

### 🚀 **6. Deploy**
- **What happens?**  
  The application is deployed to staging or production environments.
- **Types:**  
  - **Continuous Delivery:** deploy to staging automatically, manual prod approval
  - **Continuous Deployment:** everything is automatic to production
- **Example:**  
  Helm chart deploy to Kubernetes, `kubectl apply`, `terraform apply`

---

### 📊 **7. Monitor / Feedback**
- **What happens?**  
  Track the health of the application post-deployment.
- **Tools:**  
  Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Sentry, Datadog
- **Purpose:**  
  Alert on issues, ensure service reliability, and close the DevOps feedback loop.
